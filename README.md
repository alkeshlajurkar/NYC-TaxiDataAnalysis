# üöï NYC Taxi Data Analysis Using PySpark üöï

This project analyzes the NYC Taxi Trip dataset using **PySpark** on **Databricks** to uncover valuable insights. The goal is to optimize the NYC taxi system, improving operational efficiency and maximizing revenue for drivers and companies. 

## Project Overview
In this project, the following analyses were performed:
- Identifying pickup and drop-off hotspots
- Analyzing peak travel hours
- Calculating average tips and toll costs
- Finding the most common trip types
- Discovering busy days of the week

### Project Goals:
- Improve operational efficiency
- Enhance service quality
- Maximize revenue for taxi drivers and companies

## Tools & Technologies
- **PySpark**: Distributed data processing
- **Databricks**: Cloud-based platform for big data analytics
- **NYC Taxi Trip Dataset**: Dataset with trip information for NYC taxis

## Steps Taken
1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**
   - Loaded and explored the dataset.
   - Cleaned the data by handling missing values and converting data types.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed key features such as trip distance, pickup/dropoff locations, payment types, and more.
   - Generated insights like busiest pickup locations, peak hours, average fare/tips, and popular trip types.
   
3. **Optimization Insights**
   - Extracted insights to improve the operational efficiency of NYC's taxi system.
   - Helped in optimizing taxi availability, maximizing revenue, and enhancing customer service quality.
